[Slack Channel - cp3406_team05](https://app.slack.com/client/T0C3E7EP2/G4XDZGNM8/thread/C0K0UUFN2-1649321120.142859)




# Missed Meetings Protocol
What should a team member do if a planned meeting can’t be attended due to unforeseen circumstances?

Notify on [Slack Channel - cp3406_team05](https://app.slack.com/client/T0C3E7EP2/G4XDZGNM8/thread/C0K0UUFN2-1649321120.142859)
Follow up after the meeting with another team member for a quick catch up. This can be done via the meeting recap which is put in the chat after each meeting to direct what each member will do before the next meeting or via direct slack chats.

# Dealing with Problems
What arrangements have you agreed on for what to do if a team member is not working effectively? 
- Currently editing Git Hub Wiki page to act as documentation of meetings about specific tasks (e,g ReadMe.md; theme.md; site.md) and catching members up if they are unavailable.
- if a member is falling behind on their work they will be prompted on all channels to get their work done by the next day so we can issue the next lot of work to them. if the member is unable to complete the work on time another member will pick it up from them and complete the work while the original member moves onto their next lot of work. if the member is still unable to complete the work they will be given smaller jobs that need doing. If there are still issues it will become reflected in the peer reviews.


(E.g. if a member does not attend meetings, does not respond to communication attempts or does not complete assigned work.)
