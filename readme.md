# Dealing with Problems
What arrangements have you agreed on for what to do if a team member is not working effectively? 
- Currently editing Git Hub Wiki page to act as documentation of meetings about specific tasks (e,g ReadMe.md; theme.md; site.md) and catching members up if they are unavailable.


(E.g. if a member does not attend meetings, does not respond to communication attempts or does not complete assigned work.)
