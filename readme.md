# Communication Methods

[Discord Channel - cp3406_team05](https://discord.gg/gvrfQDEy)

We plan on meeting every Tuesday and Thursday at 8pm and scheduling extra meetings when they are needed.
Messages will be sent out via slack to arrange the meeting that will occur in Discord

# Missed Meetings Protocol
What should a team member do if a planned meeting can’t be attended due to unforeseen circumstances?

Notify on [Slack Channel - cp3406_team05](https://app.slack.com/client/T0C3E7EP2/G4XDZGNM8/thread/C0K0UUFN2-1649321120.142859)
Follow up after the meeting with another team member for a quick catch up. This can be done via the meeting recap which is put in the chat after each meeting to direct what each member will do before the next meeting or via direct slack chats. if that is unseccefull make sure to make the next meeting or schedule another one.

# Dealing with Problems
What arrangements have you agreed on for what to do if a team member is not working effectively? 
- Currently editing Git Hub Wiki page to act as documentation of meetings about specific tasks (e,g ReadMe.md; theme.md; site.md) and catching members up if they are unavailable.
- if a member is falling behind on their work they will be prompted on all channels to get their work done by the next day so we can issue the next lot of work to them. if the member is unable to complete the work on time another member will pick it up from them and complete the work while the original member moves onto their next lot of work. if the member is still unable to complete the work they will be given smaller jobs that need doing. If there are still issues it will become reflected in the peer reviews.
