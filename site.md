Once logged in you can access the Wordpress dashboard which has features such as: 
- Posts (Add new posts to webpages)
- Events (Built in plug in - adds events to the events calendar which you can choose to display on any page of your choice)
- Timeline Addons
- Media
- Pages (add new pages and catergorise them)
- Comments
- Carousel Slider
- Contact
- Membership

- Appearance (this is where you can customise the wordpress theme and add templates)
- Plugins (Search for new plugins to install or activate installed plugins)
