# Theme
The starter theme used for this website is [Underscrores](https://underscores.me/)

#### Theme Features
Features: All of the styling can be found in the SASS folder of the theme and will require some sort of post processor to compile. Currently the default sass command (sass --watch sass:.) is used to compile all scss folders into a single style.css file in the root directory. 
If any new scss files are created, they must be added to the appropriate parent scss file (such as _base.scss, _components.scss etc) found in each folder via an import statement

#### Theme layout
Menu Detail: The menu is a simple horizontal menu floated to the right of the page, consisting of images as the links. All css regarding the menu can be found under components/navigation/navigation.scss
